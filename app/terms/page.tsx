          unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
          falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
          unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
          competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
